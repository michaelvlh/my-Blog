## Description
This is a side project where I practiced creating a website using Python and Django for fun, it is not fully functional and only has the basic features.
I will be working on this more and will try host it somewhere in the future for it to act as my actual portfolio website.

## Important
I do not claim this as my original work, this project was created following the tutorial by Jasmine Finer on realpython.com
